        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            A traditional lasagna, with about half the time and effort! I 
            always cook extra to have leftovers, but the more I cook, the 
            more they eat! Serve with garlic toast and salad.

            <li>2 (14 ounce) jars marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>8 ounce ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <h5>Step 1</h5>
            <li>Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet 
                over medium-high heat. Drain excess grease, Stir in the water 
                and black olives, and season with basil, garlic powder, oregano, 
                sage, pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes. Simmer for about 
                15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the marinara sauce, and 
                remove from the heat.        
            </li>
            
            <h5>Step 2</h5>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
            
            <h5>Step 3</h5>
            <li>Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch 
                baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin 
                layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, and sprinkle with a 
                little mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce, and 
                repeat layering ending with the meat and sauce on top. Reserve 
                about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for later.
            </li>
            
            <h5>Step 4</h5>
            <li>Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check after 30 
                minutes depending on how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked 
                when you can easily stick a knife into it. Sprinkle the reserved 
                cheese over the top, and return to the oven for about 10 minutes 
                for a nice melted cheese topping.
            </li>
